# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

Councils now require producer statements to be issued prior to product being produced, often when consent is first applied for. Architects specifying product require easy access to documents with product details and correct documentation. This currently takes time and effort from both the architect and myself leading to loss of sales as other companies make it easier.


## End-User Requirements

end users will typically be architects, they will need obvious direction, ease of access to the form and everything required.


## Proposed Solution

make a web app that allows architects to input their choices into a form and then automatically create the document and give it to the end users that require it

# Relevant Implications

## Privacy implications

Making Sure End-User Data Remains Private

### Relevance to the System

the consent documents for the weatherboard are unique to each architect/client and are stored as a pdf, the only people who should be able to access them is the architect, client and timber provider.

### Impact / Considerations

i need to make sure i dont make the pdf's accessible to anyone who opens the website and is only available to the people mentioned on the document.
