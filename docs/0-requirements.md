# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

Councils now require producer statements to be issued prior to product being produced, often when consent is first applied for. Architects specifying product require easy access to documents with product details and correct documentation. This currently takes time and effort from both the architect and myself leading to loss of sales as other companies make it easier.


## End-User Requirements

end users will typically be architects, they will need obvious direction, ease of access to the form and everything required.


## Proposed Solution

make a web app that allows architects to input their choices into a form and then automatically create the document and give it to the end users that require it

- needs to take input from end user
- creates a doc PDF file based on a form that is submitted
- emails it or stores it safely
- needs to give both parties the pdf
- needs to looks nice

# Relevant Implications

## Privacy implications

Making Sure End-User Data Remains Private

### Relevance to the System

the consent documents for the weatherboard are unique to each architect/client and are stored as a pdf, the only people who should be able to access them is the architect, client and timber provider.

### Impact / Considerations

i need to make sure i dont make the pdf's accessible to anyone who opens the website and is only available to the people mentioned on the document.


## accessibility implications

Everyone can use it on any device

### Relevance to the System

arhictects are likley to need this while using a phone or pc

### Impact / Considerations

make sure it works for both and fits well into both screen sizes while staying readable


## functionality implications

the website functions

### Relevance to the System

you freely choose the options you require to create the exact document that you need

### Impact / Considerations

make sure you can make a pdf for the document that includes the options that are selectable



## Aesthetic implications

looks aesthetically pleasing

### Relevance to the System

doesnt make someone think its the wrong site if it looks poorly made

### Impact / Considerations

make the site look clean and professional



## useability implications

its gotta be clear what things do and easy to traverse pages

### Relevance to the System

clearly state what every input option for the form is for and clearly state where and what buttons go/do

### Impact / Considerations

buttons should have some sort of icon or text showing what it is they do. forms should state what fields do
