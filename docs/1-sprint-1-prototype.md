# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## Initial Database Design

This is the first iteration of the planned database, done without much thought and to give a basis and idea of what to do

## UI 'Flow'

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':
there are 3 different initial designs all with different flow

### Testing

I showed all 3 prototypes to the person who needs the site.
-
 > they said they liked prototype 3 the most because it was simpler and less info at a time and more pages with smaller parts of the form is easier to read and reduces stress load on end users.

 > they also mentioned a mistake i made, they told me that the field of timber grade   isnt necessary since it will nearly always be weatherboard.



### Changes / Improvements
Picked the 3rd Prototype to use

i went through and fixed the problems such as
- removed choose grade field from website, and removed it from the DB
- the chosen proto type didnt have any way for a person to find their document, the reason is because it needs to be discussed with with the person, because security may be a problem and they know what can and cant be done, so ill need further testing for that but for now ill add a basic one to give structure for the next step
- re-arranged db slightly, not very important
- new iteration:

 - new DB with grade field removed, also ordered it around differently:

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

*FIGMA PROTOTYPE - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT*

### Testing



### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

*FIGMA IMPROVED PROTOTYPE - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT*

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of colour, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

*FIGMA REFINED PROTOTYPE - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT*

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

## Sprint Review

Replace this text with a statement about how the sprint has moved the project forward - key success point, any things that didn't go so well, etc.
